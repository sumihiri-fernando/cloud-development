## Getting Started
[Include instructions on how to set up the project locally, dependencies, and any necessary configurations.]

## Features
- User registration and authentication
- Role-based access control
- Continuous deployment with AWS CodePipeline
- Integration with Amazon Cognito for user management

## Deployment
[Provide details on how to deploy the application, mentioning both the CodePipeline method and any other methods used.]

## Evaluation

### Things I Did Well
1. **Effective Use of Spring Security:**  
   Successfully integrated Spring Security, enhancing user authentication and authorization.

2. **Automated Deployment with AWS CodePipeline:**  
   Set up AWS CodePipeline for continuous deployment, reducing manual errors and streamlining the process.

3. **Integration of Amazon Cognito:**  
   Implemented Amazon Cognito for secure user identity management, allowing smooth user registration and login.

### Things I Could Have Done Better
1. **Improved Documentation:**  
   Could have included more detailed explanations and diagrams in the documentation.

2. **Code Modularity and Cleanliness:**  
   Some parts of the codebase could have been more modular for better readability and maintainability.

3. **Testing Strategies:**  
   More thorough testing strategies, including unit and integration tests, could have been implemented.

### Critical Analysis of Implementation

#### Lessons Learned
- Gained insights into web application security and the benefits of integrating services like Amazon Cognito.
- Learned the importance of automation in deployment processes to save time and reduce errors.

#### Future Improvements
If I were to carry out this project again, I would:
1. **Focus on Comprehensive Documentation:**  
   Prioritize thorough documentation of the code and deployment processes from the start.

2. **Enhance Testing Practices:**  
   Implement a robust testing framework, including unit and integration tests.

3. **Modularize Code:**  
   Ensure a modular code structure from the beginning to improve maintainability.

### Conclusion
This project was a significant learning experience that improved my skills in web development, security practices, and deployment strategies.
